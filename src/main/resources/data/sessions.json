      "description": "Most web and mobile apps benefit from being \"reactive\": if something changes in the backend, they can immediately show it in every connected frontend, without a page refresh. Reactivity is especially important if your app is \"multiplayer\": with multiple humans or agentic AIs interacting with each other via your backend - like chatrooms, dashboards, or collaborative editing, for example.\n\nBuilding a reactive, multiplayer app with Python has been pretty complicated though. Hurdles include:\n\n* How do you send events from the backend to the frontend (probably written in JavaScript)?\n\n* How does your backend even know that there's events to send, especially if your app gets big enough to need multiple servers?\n\n* How do you manage and safely change the state shared between frontends, ideally without writing yet more JavaScript?\n\n* How do you safely serialize/deserialize Python objects for clients that may be running old code (backwards compatibility), while also keeping type safety?\n\n* How can reactive APIs work if you also have clients that aren't JavaScript, for example other Python programs?\n\nThis workshop will use reboot.dev to show you how to build these reactive, multiplayer apps!",

      "description": "Web applications have gone through many evolutions over the last two decades. Web development is a relatively young industry, yet the expectations have grown rapidly putting all sorts of constraints on our tools and workflows. Because of the constant churn, it’s difficult to keep up with all the changes and evolutions in how we approach building web applications. Starting with server-centric models, swinging all the way to fully client-side SPAs, to revisiting server-first MPAs, it seems like the ecosystem has been all over the place. At the same time, platform limitations and tooling complexity has led to developers seeking simpler solutions to more relevant problems.\n\nThis session attempts to explain the various approaches and architectures of web applications by going back to fundamentals. We will see the issues with server-centric models that led to client-first development, issues with client-first model that have led the push back to server-centric models, and how both architectures have learnt from each other and addressed their own limitations. You will walk away with a solid understanding of web architecture, and some ideas on how to improve the architecture of your own web applications for better user and developer experience.",

      "description": "In a monolith, achieving consistency is easy - just use a transaction! In a distributed world, where we mix legacy and greenfield, getting systems to agree becomes quite a bit more complex. We have different databases, different communication methods, caches, and more. How can we get anything to agree on the state of anything?\n\nBuilding reliable communication and agreements between systems is possible - but it requires careful design and application of well-established patterns.\n\nIn this session, we'll look at how to implement various consistency and transactional patterns, to support both real-time and async updates. We'll dive in to the inbox and outbox patterns to support transactional messaging. We'll also look at long-running transaction patterns such as sagas and process managers to manage agreements between systems. Finally, we'll look at a full working example that crosses databases, APIs, messaging, and more.",

And why not, when you have the benefits of increased scalability, fault-tolerance, performance, and decoupling? From ordering your latest gadget to dealing with mission-critical, high-performance systems, messaging is gaining traction.\n\nA message queue is the most critical infrastructure in distributed systems that use messaging. There are plenty of choices, ranging from databases to cloud solutions. But how do you decide what is the best fit for your organization and your system?\n\nJoin me as I discuss some of the most popular queuing systems—AWS SQS, RabbitMQ, and Azure Service Bus —along with their benefits, trade-offs, and gotchas, accompanied by code samples. By the end of this session, attendees will have a clear understanding of each system's strengths and weaknesses and will be equipped with the knowledge to make informed decisions on the best messaging solution for their specific application architecture.",

      "description": "So, you wanna be an architect. You may be asking yourself, what does that even mean? As an individual contributor, it can be hard to tell what it takes to cross the bridge from implementing concrete decisions to making them yourself. How do you ensure that what you're building today doesn't become tomorrow's technical debt? Are you even qualified to make these decisions?\n\nWell, someone thought I was. In this talk, we anticipate some challenges we might run into when taking on these types of tasks by analyzing the traits and behaviors of software architects and how they can influence a team's ability to implement a solution. The strategies of good architects — such as balancing their level of control over a team, explaining and negotiating the trade-offs of a particular path, and being able to see just enough into the future to avoid overengineering — are likely already present in the thought patterns you possess from being an individual contributor.\n\nWhether you aim to grow into an architect role or want to make better choices as you develop code, this talk will give you the tools to bridge the gap between writing software and shaping systems. Are you up to the task? Join me, and you'll find out.",

      "description": "How do you modernize beyond a 10-30 year legacy?\n\nOrganizations often rely on applications that have been in use for over a decade. These legacy systems are typically maintained on an \"as needed\" basis and can become single points of failure, leading to costly disruptions.\n\nBut how do you modernize over 10 years of legacy? Should you throw it all out and start over? That approach can be even more expensive. The answer is nuanced: it depends.\n\nIt depends on the specific needs of the business: does it need to scale? What about safety or privacy? How about performance? What technology stacks are already in use at the customer? Is that important to them? Architectural decisions and trade-offs must be made.\n\nAs an application modernization architect, I have led numerous projects to update legacy systems. In this session, I will share my experiences and the strategies I use to navigate these challenges.\n\nBy the end of the session, you will have a clear understanding of where to start and the steps to take to bring your business-critical applications into the modern age.",

Everything was greenfield and productivity couldn't be higher. Until the production switch flipped and nothing worked in a proper distributed environment.\n\nSomething went horribly awry in our microservice megadisaster, but monoliths can ease the pain by removing the distributed nature of our system. However, we don't want to repeat our mistakes of creating a big ball of mud, or a big ball of distributed mud. Enter the modular monolith, an architecture that preserves the beneficial aspects of a single application and the advantages of isolated areas of data and behavior.\n\nIn this talk, we'll look at the various patterns of modularizing a monolith. We'll answer such questions as \"what even is a Module?\", how to draw module boundaries, and evolutionary design techniques to migrate an existing monolith. Finally, we'll look at techniques to extract modules into services, giving the best possible chance for a microservice architecture to thrive.",

      "description": "“Edge AI” refers to the process of leveraging artificial intelligence in applications that run at the edge, such as mobile, IoT and custom embedded applications like interactive kiosks.\n\nThe concept combines AI processing with edge computing, a technical architecture that brings computing resources and data storage to the near side of the network, closer to the applications that consume it. By running AI and data processing locally, such as in a near proximity data center or even on a mobile or IoT device, applications become faster and more reliable because they aren't dependent on the internet for accessing data or AI models.\n\nEdge AI is becoming a popular approach for delivering smart, secure and hyper-personalized applications with the highest levels of speed and availability, as well as security and efficient bandwidth. But because AI requires data, you need more than just the right models. To achieve the promise of edge AI, you need a cloud-to-edge database.\n\nThrough discussion and live demonstration you will learn how Couchbase natively supports edge AI architectures by providing:\n\n- A cloud native database with vector search\n- An embedded database with vector search on-device\n- Data synchronization from the cloud to the edge",

      "description": "This session offers a hands-on, security-focused look at how to implement and scale authorization for MCP servers using modern OAuth 2.1 best practices. As more teams adopt the Model Context Protocol to enable AI agents, developer tools, and orchestration systems to interact with external APIs, securing those interactions becomes critical—especially in enterprise settings where multi-tenancy, scoped access, and separation of concerns are non-negotiable.\n\nWe’ll walk through how to structure your MCP server to enforce fine-grained authorization across different tool calls, ensuring that every request is evaluated against issued scopes and contextual access rules. You’ll learn how to integrate external identity providers and authorization servers cleanly into the flow—delegating token issuance, validation, and client trust establishment without complicating the core execution logic of your server, as per the latest authorization specification.\n\nA key theme in the session is addressing the gap in how MCP clients behave today. Most implementations fail to follow a progressive scoping model—often requesting all possible access during dynamic registration or initial configuration. We’ll explore strategies for guiding clients toward least-privilege access, supporting incremental scope requests, and handling re-consent or step-up flows when more access is needed.\n\nThe session will also cover practical implementation patterns: validating tokens and scopes, handling different client types (human vs. agent), mapping scopes to tool capabilities, and managing policy enforcement at both the tenant and action level. You’ll come away with architecture guidance and working models that you can adapt to your environment.\n\nThis talk is designed for developers, platform engineers, and security architects building or integrating with MCP-based systems. If you’re looking to make your MCP deployment secure, scalable, and ready for production—this session will show you how.",

      "description": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have an uncanny ability to generate human-like responses, effectively rendering the Turing Test obsolete– but do we really understand how they work? As models advance seemingly overnight, our ability to interpret their decisions struggles to keep pace. The field of Interpretability isn’t just about explaining outputs or offering post-hoc reasoning— it’s about uncovering how these models actually process and represent information.\n\nThis talk explores the latest research shaping AI Interpretability, from Anthropic’s 2024 work on mechanistic interpretability and monosemanticity scaling, to methodologies that have historically aimed at explaining models but fall short for today’s LLMs. We’ll clarify the distinction between explainability and interpretability, their respective use cases, and the current toolkit for understanding black-box models. Along the way, we’ll debunk common myths (like the tendency to anthropomorphize LLMs), and discuss why interpretable AI is essential for both reliability and trust.\n\nFor engineers at all levels– whether integrating LLMs into applications or advancing AI research– interpretability is no longer optional. It’s necessary for debugging unexpected model behavior, improving efficiency, and ensuring AI systems remain adaptable and aligned with human goals. If we don’t keep up, we risk being outpaced by models we barely understand, yet still utilize. Attendees will leave with a clearer framework for assessing LLM behavior and practical strategies for applying interpretability techniques to real-world AI systems.",

And who *wouldn't* want to work with [Success Kid](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/success-kid-i-hate-sandcastles).\n\nBut can we even find out if we have a meme twin? There are lots of memes. And lots of people. How could we possibly search them all? Well, it's easier than you think if we turn those memes into embeddings and search them with a vector database!\n\nBut what's an embedding? And what's a vector database? Well, that's what I'll cover in this session. I'll begin by exploring embeddings, showing how unstructured data, such as text and images, can be translated into hyper-dimensional arrays—called vectors—using both common and custom AI models. Then I'll talk about vector databases, covering what they are and how you can use them to store and search those embeddings with embeddings of your own.\n\nOf course, we'll do this all by example. I've turned all the big memes—from [Ancient Aliens Guy](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/ancient-aliens) to [Zombie Boy](https://imgflip.com/memegenerator/184608242/zombie-boy)—into embeddings and have loaded them into a vector database.

      "description": "This is the case study of how we changed how we ship software.\n\nWith thousands of customers, each in their own Kubernetes container, deploying updates was tough. Off-hours schedules meant it took over 24 hours to push a new version. If something broke, we had to scramble. Using a Canary-based approach, we could update small groups of customers at a time. We built a tool to stop rollouts fast when issues appeared, limiting the damage.\n\nIn the past, new features went to everyone at once. Rolling back wasn't an option. If something failed, it'd leave customers stuck in the mess. Now, using OpenFeature, we hide new functionality behind feature flags. We release features to small groups, gather feedback, and test internally for weeks. If things go wrong, we flip the flag off and move on.\n\nThis two-pronged approach lets us avoid risky big-bang releases. We went from deploying every 10 days to every 4, with fewer than 1% high-severity defects. Most of these are resolved before customers notice them.",

      "description": "In software development, technical debt often becomes a barrier between business, product, and engineering teams. This talk will explain how storytelling can be a powerful tool to demystify technical debt, making it accessible and understandable for everyone in any team or organization. We will step through an example of how unrecognized and concerning amounts of growing tech debt was explained to align stakeholders through the power story telling. By bridging the gap between teams, we will show how we fostered a culture where everyone becomes a steward of the product, always thinking about the most impactful customer experience.\n\nTechnical debt is often misunderstood and undervalued, leading to decisions that can negatively impact the product and customer experience. By using storytelling, we can create a shared understanding and commitment to managing technical debt, ensuring that all teams are aligned and working towards the same goals.\n\nThis session will focus on the following learning outcomes:\n* Learn how to explain technical debt in simple, relatable terms using storytelling techniques.\n* Discover strategies to improve communication and collaboration between business, product, and engineering teams.\n* Emphasize the importance of thinking in service of the customer and the services they value.",

      "description": "At a developer conference in New York, I discovered something unexpected. The leading developers weren't just experimenting with AI, they were truly collaborating with it. This was my turning point. I'd been hiding my own AI usage, afraid it would expose me as the impostor I always feared I was. But that fear transformed into curiosity: could embracing AI actually make me a better developer?\nWhat followed was a journey of professional reinvention. Instead of seeing AI as a threat or a crutch, I learned to treat different AI models as members of my development team, each with their own strengths and working styles. This mindset shift helped me grow from a developer comfortable in two languages to someone confidently working across seven, guiding AI collaborators rather than fighting my tools or feeling guilty about using them.\nThis new approach to professional growth helped me tackle challenges I never thought possible. When tasked with creating a Laravel starter kit, despite minimal PHP experience, I drew on my AI collaboration techniques to produce work that earned approval from Laravel's creator himself. The key wasn't just using AI tools - it was learning to orchestrate discussions, maintain context, and most importantly, stay in control of the development process.\n\nAttendees will learn:\n\n- How to overcome impostor syndrome around AI usage in development\n- Techniques for growing your capabilities by treating AI as team members\n- Strategies for maintaining agency and understanding while leveraging AI\n- Methods for expanding your technical range through thoughtful AI collaboration\n\nBecause ultimately, this isn't about AI replacing developers. It's about growing as a developer by thoughtfully embracing new ways of working.",

How can engineers and teams work together effectively across team boundaries?\n\nIn recent years, the practice of InnerSource has risen as a methodology for facilitating cross-team collaboration across the company. InnerSource is the application of open source project management and work strategies applied to company-internal software. An InnerSource mindset treats all software inside the organization as free and open for anyone to use and contribute, much the same way as open source outside the company.\n\nSuccessful adoption of InnerSource is an intentional process that, if done right, unlocks greater engineering efficiencies, increased innovation, a more empowering developer environment, and easier participation in open source. In this talk, we give an explanation of InnerSource, specific examples of its adoption in various companies and industries, anecdotes and data on the value it gives, and tips, tricks, and gotchas for introducing it into your company.",

In my team’s unique experience, this outside force was a global pandemic. In April of 2020, our Kansas City lab’s legacy software could not scale to handle the unique needs to provide mass Covid testing, so we developed our own. Throughout this venture, we were constantly presented with timelines that were wildly unattainable, and development was constantly in a race against time. In this discussion, I’ll step through strategies we utilized during this Crisis Coding which were successful. Our lab would go on to perform nearly one million Covid tests utilizing our solution, and supported testing for local hospitals, businesses, school districts, and mass test sites.\nNow that the pandemic has passed, the impossible deadlines never seem to have subsided, but the lessons learned throughout our experience can be helpful to anyone dealing with unrealistic timelines.",

As we advance in our careers as software developers, we keep getting further and further away from the fundamentals. That’s a shame because the fundamentals are useful in our day jobs, appear often as technical interview questions, and honestly they’re also really fun to poke at. It’s right there in the name!\n\nThis workshop is a refresher, or crash course, on the basic data structures and algorithms that underpin the software we build. We’ll focus on techniques for recognizing the structure of a problem, finding a relevant data structure to help solve it, and ballparking the cost of computing answers in terms of time and memory. We won’t be implementing structures from scratch. We’ll look at:\n\n* Segmenting an image using the color of adjacent pixels to find edges\n* The importance of good hashing through the lens of solving a Rubik’s cube\n* Rapidly testing collision for all sprites in a video game field\n* Efficiently finding similar items in a large catalog of items\n\nAttendees can expect to come away with:\n\n* Better familiarity with common data structures\n* A process for identifying the correct data structure to solve a problem with\n* A (re)-introduction to Big O & Big 𝚯 analysis",

Modern AI provides an opportunity to streamline and automate developer workflows for better productivity – AI Models have gotten very good with React development and AI Agents can be provided contextual tools with Model Context Protocol (MCP). Throw in some AI goodness as GitHub Copilot Extension or MCP Tools - and developers have everything to supercharge frontend development.\n\nMany traditional .NET shops now do React in the frontend, and modern .NET WebAPI as backend, with support for OpenAPI for building API endpoints over data. But what if there is a need to see React apps working on mobile/desktop form factors? Armed with modern smart WebViews, .NET MAUI is more than capable of welcoming web content to native land. In fact, Blazor/React developers should feel empowered to bring web UI components, routing and styling to native cross-platform apps, while gaining complete platform API access.\n\nTurns out, .NET & React make for a great mixed tech stack and AI helps with productivity – good for developer flexibility.",

His goal was to study the nature of functions and how they can interact.\n\nThis talk describes the concepts behind Lambda Calculus. It shows how in a system that only provides the ability to refer to variables, define functions, and apply functions, we can perform many operations that we take for granted in programming languages. These include Boolean logic and many forms of arithmetic.\n\nYou owe it to yourself to be exposed to the amazing capabilities of functions!",

Perhaps you’ve been thinking about learning it, but the thought of having to do another set of “Hello World” style exercises is filling you with dread. Is there a more fun way to get up to speed with Python?\n\nYes, there is, and it’s called Ren’Py. It’s billed as a visual novel engine and often used for writing dating simulation games, but it’s so much more than that. It’s a platform that lets you code in Python (and more) and deploy to desktop, web, and even mobile platforms, and with a fraction of the effort required by React, Vue, or Angular. It’s a fun framework that’s been used to produce games you can find on Steam, but it’s got applications well beyond amusement.\n\nIn this session, we’ll look not just at the basics of Ren’Py development, but the building of a dating game based on KFC’s official game, “I Love You Colonel Sanders,” a simple turn-based combat game starring Florida Man, and building mobile apps in a way that’s less frustrating than usual.",

But when we don’t understand that code, we can all too often dismiss, disparage, or even simply delete it - and that’s a mistake!\n\nAlmost all the code we interact with was written by other humans, and they wrote the code that way for a reason. If we take the time to understand the context and the story behind a piece of code, we can infer a lot about what those humans meant to achieve, what their culture was like, and what they valued… in other words, we need to become an archaeologist!\n\nLet’s work to build a better understanding of the code we didn’t write, and of who wrote it and why. Using the tools of psychology you can learn what’s happening to your brain when you’re reading someone else’s code, and then learn how you can make understanding it take less cognitive effort. Using the tools of archaeology you can learn how to use your development environment to find the real stories of the people that wrote it, and how that story can protect you from making the same mistakes they did.

Need to store some relational data? “Well, I better fire up a full-fat Postgres deployment!” And none of this even touches on \"dependency hell\". Yikes.\n\nMany developers often forget (or in my experience, simply don’t know) that for the most common tasks on UNIX-alike systems, there’s likely already command-line software installed to do the job! The GNU Project collectively provides nearly four hundred pieces of software to solve common (and not-so-common) computational problems. Outside of the GNU ecosystem, there are plenty of small-footprint, low- or no-dependency software packages available through a package manager or direct install to solve any straggling issues you may have.\n\nIn this talk, I will demonstrate how to resolve some of the most common or frustrating tasks developers might face using a sample of these tools: local databases; data preprocessing; JSON parsing & filtering; parallelization; task orchestration; interacting with REST APIs & remote files; and more!",

      "title": "htmx - Web Development Simplified",
      "description": "This talk describes building web applications focused on hypermedia, an approach that differs significantly from the SPA frameworks popular today such as React and Angular.\n\nToday, web apps typically use client-side JavaScript code to send HTTP requests to server endpoints that query/update databases and return JSON data. The client code then transforms JSON into an HTML presentation.\n\nThis is not what Roy Fielding had in mind when he wrote his famous dissertation \"Architectural Styles and the Design of Network-based Software Architectures\" that gave birth to REST.\n\nHTMX is a small client-side JavaScript library that adds support for new HTML attributes. These enable responding to specific interactions (ex. click) with any HTML element by sending an HTTP request using any verb. The response must contain HTML. Rather than performing a complete page refresh, the returned HTML replaces an existing DOM element or is inserted relative to one.\n\nThis approach removes the need to serialize data to JSON on the server, parse JSON on the client, and convert it to HTML. It also simplifies state management because all state can reside only on the server.\n\nThe server can be implemented using any programming language and server framework. While HTMX itself is implemented in JavaScript, HTMX enables writing complete web applications without authoring any JavaScript code.\n\nTopics covered will include:\n\n- Introduction to htmx\n- Choosing a tech stack\n- Example htmx app\n- Pros and cons\n- Frequently used htmx attributes\n- Out-of-band swaps\n- Input validation\n- Lazy loading\n- Active search\n- Infinite scroll\n- Alpine\n- Resources",

I can’t find ANYTHING. This takes ZILLION clicks. Nothing makes SENSE! I’m WASTING time! ANOTHER ERROR! AARRRRRGGGHH!\n\nMy blood pressure rises while I yell words that would deeply embarrass my mother. I have given in to interface rage. And I am far from alone.\n\nUsers today are often massively frustrated by the sites, apps, and software we make. They are furious when they can’t quickly do what they want. And this fury has consequences. Angry users rush through tasks, make more mistakes, and miss obvious things. This makes them more upset and less able to use our products. Yes, they blame us.\n\nSo what can we do? How do we make products that help users calmly, peacefully, and easily accomplish their goals? How do we make sites, apps, and software rage-proof?\n\nDeep breaths. In this session, I’ll show you how.",

      "title": "Usability 101: Principles for Better User Experiences",
      "description": "Elevator Pitch\n---\nUsability is the gateway to a product's success—it’s the first thing users interact with, and it shapes their impression within seconds. A poor user experience can lead to immediate abandonment, like uninstalling an app that feels clunky or confusing. But how can we ensure great usability? In this talk, let’s explore key principles and practical strategies to create user-friendly designs that captivate and retain your audience.\n\nProblem Statement\n---\nProduct Quality is traditionally linked to functional correctness, ensuring that a product works as intended. However, usability—a critical aspect of quality that directly impacts user experience—is often underrated or overlooked. While functionality ensures a product’s capability, poor usability can render those functions irrelevant if users find the application confusing, frustrating, or difficult to navigate. In some cases, usability is even more important than functionality; after all, a perfectly functioning feature is meaningless if users cannot or will not use it. The key aspects of a usability are important for everyone: Designers, Developers and Testers.\n\nProposal\n---\nI will go over practical examples from my actual projects for each usability aspect.\n\n* Stability: Deliver consistent, reliable performance.\n* Lean Design: Eliminate unnecessary complexity.\n* Clarity: Create intuitive and easily understandable interfaces.\n* Simplicity: Simplify workflows and reduce cognitive load.\n* User Expectations: Align with industry standards and user needs.\n* Error Handling: Provide meaningful feedback and recovery options.\n* Accessibility: Ensure inclusivity for diverse users and needs.\n\nBy sharing real-life examples, we will discuss not only good usability practices, but also ways to broaden the horizons of quality assurance. When I was working as a QA engineer on a project, after discussing with the Product Owner, we successfully removed some unnecessary pages from the web app, reducing the need to maintain several test cases. This was a strong demonstration of the initiatives QA professionals can take beyond simply running test cases to improve efficiency.\n\nKey Takeaways\n---\n* Recognition of usability as a critical aspect of product success\n* Application of principles like stability, lean design, clarity, simplicity, user expectations, error handling, and accessibility\n* Collaboration across teams to embed usability throughout the development process,\n* Driving efficiency by removing unnecessary features,\n* Taking proactive initiative to propose usability improvements that enhance user satisfaction and product quality.",

While they may seem functional at first glance, many users with disabilities encounter a maze of invisible walls, from keyboard traps to inaccessible CAPTCHAs. It's as if GLaDOS designed these forms herself to test us!\n\nIn this session, we will debug the accessibility issues of a real React login component live, similar to traversing those test chambers: Using an actual screen reader, we'll show how small improvements, such as proper ARIA implementation and effective focus management, can transform a complex test chamber into a smooth user experience. Additionally, we will address the common pitfalls that GLaDOS might throw at us in both the Portal universe and the real world. Last but not least, we'll discover authentication features, which will help us keep authentication accessible for everyone.",
